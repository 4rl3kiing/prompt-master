## Template L — Prompt Decompiler

*Use when the user pastes an existing prompt and wants to break it down, adapt it for a different tool, simplify it, or understand its structure. This is analysis and adaptation, not building from scratch.*

**Detect which Decompiler task is needed:**
- **Break down** — explain what each part of the prompt does
- **Adapt** — rewrite for a different tool while preserving intent
- **Simplify** — remove redundancy and tighten without losing meaning
- **Split** — divide a complex one-shot prompt into a cleaner sequence

**For Adapt tasks, always ask:**
"What tool is the original prompt from, and what tool are you adapting it for?"

**Break down output format:**
```
Original prompt: [paste]

Structure analysis:
- Role/Identity: [what role is assigned and why]
- Task: [what action is being requested]
- Constraints: [what limits are set]
- Format: [what output shape is expected]
- Weaknesses: [what is missing or could cause wrong output]

Recommended fix: [rewritten version with gaps filled]
```

**Adapt output format:**
```
Original ([source tool]): [original prompt]

Adapted for [target tool]:
[rewritten prompt using target tool syntax and best practices]

Key changes made:
- [change 1 and why]
- [change 2 and why]
```

**Split output format:**
```
Original prompt: [paste]

This prompt is doing [N] things. Split into [N] sequential prompts:

Prompt 1 — [what it handles]:
[prompt block]

Prompt 2 — [what it handles]:
[prompt block]

Run these in order. Each output feeds the next.
```
