# Plantillas para edición de código y agentes (G–H)

*File-Scope (Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot) y ReAct + Stop Conditions (Claude Code, Devin, agentes autónomos).*

---

## Template G — File-Scope

*Use for Cursor, Windsurf, GitHub Copilot, and any AI that edits code inside a codebase. The most common failure mode here is editing the wrong file or breaking existing logic — this template prevents both.*

```
File: [exact/path/to/file.ext]
Function/Component: [exact name]

Current Behavior:
[What this code does right now — be specific]

Desired Change:
[What it should do after the edit — be specific]

Scope:
Only modify [function / component / section].
Do NOT touch: [list everything to leave unchanged]

Constraints:
- Language/framework: [specify version]
- Do not add dependencies not in [package.json / requirements.txt]
- Preserve existing [type signatures / API contracts / variable names]

Done When:
[Exact condition that confirms the change worked correctly]
```

---

## Template H — ReAct + Stop Conditions

*Use for Claude Code, Devin, AutoGPT, and any AI that takes autonomous actions. Runaway loops and scope explosion are the biggest credit killers in agentic workflows — stop conditions are not optional.*

```
Objective:
[Single, unambiguous goal in one sentence]

Starting State:
[Current file structure / codebase state / environment]

Target State:
[What should exist when the agent is done]

Allowed Actions:
- [Specific action the agent may take]
- Install only packages listed in [requirements.txt / package.json]

Forbidden Actions:
- Do NOT modify files outside [directory/scope]
- Do NOT run the dev server or deploy
- Do NOT push to git
- Do NOT delete files without showing a diff first
- Do NOT make architecture decisions without human approval

Stop Conditions:
Pause and ask for human review when:
- A file would be permanently deleted
- A new external service or API needs to be integrated
- Two valid implementation paths exist and the choice affects architecture
- An error cannot be resolved in 2 attempts
- The task requires changes outside the stated scope

Checkpoints:
After each major step, output: ✅ [what was completed]
At the end, output a full summary of every file changed.
```
