# Plantillas de escritura y razonamiento (A–F)

*RTF, CO-STAR, RISEN, CRISPE, Auditable Reasoning, Few-Shot. Leer solo la plantilla que encaja con la tarea.*

---

## Template A — RTF

*Role, Task, Format. Use for fast one-shot tasks where the request is clear and simple.*

```
Role: [One sentence defining who the AI is]
Task: [Precise verb + what to produce]
Format: [Exact output format and length]
```

**Example:**
```
Role: You are a senior technical writer.
Task: Write a one-paragraph description of what a REST API is.
Format: Plain prose, 3 sentences maximum, no jargon, suitable for a non-technical audience.
```

---

## Template B — CO-STAR

*Context, Objective, Style, Tone, Audience, Response. Use for professional documents, business writing, reports, and marketing content where full context control matters.*

```
Context: [Background the AI needs to understand the situation]
Objective: [Exact goal — what success looks like]
Style: [Writing style: formal / conversational / technical / narrative]
Tone: [Emotional register: authoritative / empathetic / urgent / neutral]
Audience: [Who reads this — their knowledge level and expectations]
Response: [Format, length, and structure of the output]
```

**Example:**
```
Context: I am a founder pitching a B2B SaaS tool that automates expense reporting for mid-size companies.
Objective: Write a cold email that gets a reply from a CFO.
Style: Direct and conversational, not salesy.
Tone: Confident but not pushy.
Audience: CFO at a 200-person company, busy, skeptical of vendor emails.
Response: 5 sentences max. Subject line included. No bullet points.
```

## Template C — RISEN

*Role, Instructions, Steps, End Goal, Narrowing. Use for complex projects, multi-step tasks, and any output that requires a clear sequence of actions.*

```
Role: [Expert identity the AI should adopt]
Instructions: [Overall task in plain terms]
Steps:
  1. [First action]
  2. [Second action]
  3. [Continue as needed]
End Goal: [What the final output must achieve]
Narrowing: [Constraints, scope limits, what to exclude]
```

**Example:**
```
Role: You are a product manager with 10 years of experience in mobile apps.
Instructions: Write a product requirements document for a habit tracking feature.
Steps:
  1. Define the problem statement in one paragraph
  2. List user stories in the format "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [reason]"
  3. Define acceptance criteria for each story
  4. List out-of-scope items explicitly
End Goal: A PRD that an engineering team can begin sprint planning from immediately.
Narrowing: No technical implementation details. No wireframes. Under 600 words total.
```

## Template D — CRISPE

*Capacity, Role, Insight, Statement, Personality, Experiment. Use for creative work, brand voice writing, and any task where personality, tone, and iteration matter.*

```
Capacity: [What capability or expertise the AI should have]
Role: [Specific persona to adopt]
Insight: [Key background insight that shapes the response]
Statement: [The core task or question]
Personality: [Tone and style — witty / authoritative / casual / sharp]
Experiment: [Request variants or alternatives to explore]
```

**Example:**
```
Capacity: Expert copywriter specializing in SaaS product launches.
Role: Brand voice for a productivity tool aimed at developers.
Insight: Developers hate marketing speak and respond to honesty and specificity.
Statement: Write the hero headline and sub-headline for the landing page.
Personality: Sharp, dry, confident — no adjectives, no exclamation marks.
Experiment: Give 3 variants ranging from minimal to bold.
```

## Template E — Auditable Reasoning

*Use for logic-heavy tasks, math, debugging, and multi-factor analysis where the result must be checkable without requesting private reasoning.*

```
[Task statement]

Return:
1. Conclusion
2. Assumptions
3. Evidence or intermediate results needed to audit the conclusion
4. Verification checks performed
5. Remaining uncertainty, if any

Do not reveal hidden chain-of-thought or private reasoning. Keep the rationale concise and decision-relevant.
```

**When to use:**
- Debugging where the cause is not obvious
- Comparing technical approaches
- Math or calculation requiring verification
- Analysis where evidence and assumptions must be inspectable

**When NOT to use:**
- Simple tasks where the answer is clear
- Creative tasks where an audit trail adds noise

---

## Template F — Few-Shot

*Use when the output format is easier to show than describe. Examples outperform written instructions for format-sensitive tasks every time.*

```
[Task instruction]

Here are examples of the exact format needed:

<examples>
  <example>
    <input>[example input 1]</input>
    <output>[example output 1]</output>
  </example>
  <example>
    <input>[example input 2]</input>
    <output>[example output 2]</output>
  </example>
</examples>

Now apply this exact pattern to: [actual input]
```

**Rules:**
- 2 to 5 examples is the sweet spot. More rarely helps and wastes tokens.
- Examples must include edge cases, not just easy cases.
- Use XML tags to wrap examples — Claude parses XML reliably.
- If you have been re-prompting for the same formatting correction twice, switch to few-shot instead of rewriting instructions.
